# üß† What Is a Spectrum?
A spectrum is an adaptation of Street Epistemology, a technique rooted in the Socratic method that uses thoughtful questioning to examine the foundations of one's beliefs. In a spectrum, participants physically position themselves along a spectrum line to indicate their level of agreement or disagreement with a given statement. This visual representation facilitates open dialogue and helps individuals understand the diversity of perspectives on complex issues.

## üéØ Objectives of a Spectrum 

 - Encourage critical thinking and self-reflection on personal belief.
 - Foster respectful and meaningful conversations among individuals with differing viewpoint.
 - Develop skills in active listening and constructive dialogu.
 - Promote understanding and empathy through shared exploration of idea.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

1. **Statement Presentation**: A facilitator introduces a thought-provoking statement for discussion.
2. **Physical Positioning**: Participants stand along a spectrum line that represents a range of agreement or disagreement with the statement.
3. **Dialogue and Exploration**: Through guided questions and discussions, participants share their reasoning, challenge assumptions, and consider alternative viewpoints.
4. **Reflection and Adjustment**: As the conversation progresses, individuals may choose to adjust their position on the spectrum, reflecting a shift in their perspective based on the dialogue.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Consideration

Engaging in a Spectrum requires a willingness to openly express one's beliefs and to respectfully consider differing opinions. Participants should be prepared for the possibility of standing alone in their viewpoint and should feel comfortable with public discourse.

For a practical demonstration of a Spectrum, you can watch the following video:

# ‚≠ê How to use OSR Spectrum?

The easiest to run an online spectrum is to use: 

- The official instance (but in French only) from the non-profit organization "Opinions Sur Rue": https://spectrum.opinions-sur-rue.fr
![Screenshot of the OSR instance](docs/osr_screenshot.png)

- or the experimental instance maybe less stable but with all experimental features: https://spectrum.utile.space

- the third option is you to run the software from that repository.

## üöÄ Deploying your own instance

As you can see the application in split in two parts: 
- a frontend made with Svelte,
- and a backend written in Golang. 

To run the application we recommend you to use the docker-compose.yml provided in that repo. 

Configure the [`.env`](.env) first with your desired logo, name, and domain names. 

Then clone the project on your host running Docker and run:
``` 
docker-compose up -d
```

We recommend using Traefik as a web server/reverse proxy as it is pretty straightforward to setup as you can see in our `docker-compose.yml`.
