## üß† What Is a Spectrum?
A spectrum is an adaptation of Street Epistemology, a technique rooted in the Socratic method that uses thoughtful questioning to examine the foundations of one's beliefs. In a spectrum, participants physically position themselves along a spectrum line to indicate their level of agreement or disagreement with a given statement. This visual representation facilitates open dialogue and helps individuals understand the diversity of perspectives on complex issues.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

1. **Statement Presentation*: A facilitator introduces a thought-provoking statement for discussion.
2. **Physical Positioning*: Participants stand along a spectrum line that represents a range of agreement or disagreement with the statement.
3. **Dialogue and Exploration*: Through guided questions and discussions, participants share their reasoning, challenge assumptions, and consider alternative viewpoints.
4. **Reflection and Adjustment*: As the conversation progresses, individuals may choose to adjust their position on the spectrum, reflecting a shift in their perspective based on the dialogue.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Consideration

Engaging in a Spectrum requires a willingness to openly express one's beliefs and to respectfully consider differing opinions. Participants should be prepared for the possibility of standing alone in their viewpoint and should feel comfortable with public discourse.
